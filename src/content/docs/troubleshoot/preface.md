title: Preface
description: A comprehensive guide to troubleshooting issues with the Fishstrap bootstrapper.
---

Before we begin, please ensure the following things:

- You have the latest version of the Fishstrap bootstrapper installed.
- Your internet connection is stable and working properly.
- Your device meets the minimum system requirements for running Roblox and Fishstrap (Windows 10 or later).
- Roblox is not down for maintenance. (We can't do anything about this.)

Please do not expect support if you are using an outdated version of Fishstrap. We do not support those versions for obvious reasons.

This guide will be split into two parts: one for Fishstrap and one for the Roblox client.
