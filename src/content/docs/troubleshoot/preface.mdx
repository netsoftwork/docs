## Before we begin, please ensure the following things:

- You have the latest version of the Fishstrap bootstrapper installed.
- Your internet connection is stable and working properly.
- Your device meets the minimum system requirements for running Roblox and Fishstrap (Windows 10 or later).
- Roblox is not down for maintenance. (We can't do anything about this.)
- You are not running an exploit. (Do not expect support if you are an exploiter.)

This guide will be split into two parts:
