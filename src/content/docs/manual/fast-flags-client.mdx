<Aside type="note">As of September 2025, Roblox has rolled out a whitelist system for all client flags. What this essentially means is that you will be able to use only a few specific whitelisted flags. Read more [on the Devforum.](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/allowlist-for-local-client-configuration-via-fast-flags/3966569)</Aside>

Fishstrap offers you a preset selection of FastFlags that Roblox has whitelisted for everyone to use.
These include:
- Mesh detail (Quality of ingame models)
- Anti-Aliasing quality (MSAA)
- Disabling DPI scaling (Better image quality)
- FRM Quality Override (Force in-game graphics quality)
- Rendering engine (DirectX11, Vulkan, Opengl)
- Texture quality

On top of this, Fishstrap also   offers a FastFlag editor. With the editor, you may edit FastFlags that get applied to your client. However, only whitelisted Flags will be applied to your client. You may view the current list of whitelisted flags [on the Devforum.](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/allowlist-for-local-client-configuration-via-fast-flags/3966569)
